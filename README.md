# Solubility-with-Machine-Learning

For the prediction of solubility of chemical compounds, I used a Linear Regression and XGB Regressor models.
The dataset I used was the Delaney dataset, which contains a collection of chemical compounds along with their experimentally determined solubility values.
The objective was to create a predictive model that can estimate the solubility of a compound based on its molecular structure.
I performed various steps to achieve this, including Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and Modeling, with each step having substeps.
